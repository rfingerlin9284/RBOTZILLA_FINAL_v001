## 🎯 3:1 MINIMUM TRADE FILTER

### **Rick's Trade Selection Process:**

```python
def evaluate_trade_opportunity(signal):
    """
    ONLY execute if trade has 3:1 profit/loss minimum
    This is NON-NEGOTIABLE
    """
    entry = signal['entry_price']
    stop_loss = signal['stop_loss']
    take_profit = signal['take_profit']
    
    # Calculate risk and reward
    risk = abs(entry - stop_loss)
    reward = abs(take_profit - entry)
    
    # Calculate ratio
    rr_ratio = reward / risk
    
    # HARD FILTER: Must be 3:1 or better
    if rr_ratio < 3.0:
        log_rejected_trade(signal, f"RR too low: {rr_ratio:.2f}:1")
        return False  # SKIP THIS TRADE
    
    # Additional quality checks
    if signal['ml_confidence'] < 0.65:
        return False  # ML not confident enough
    
    if signal['edge_score'] < 0.70:
        return False  # Edge not strong enough
    
    # PASSED ALL FILTERS - This is a quality trade!
    log_approved_trade(signal, f"RR: {rr_ratio:.2f}:1, Edge: {signal['edge_score']:.0%}")
    return True
```

### **Result:**

- ❌ 2.8:1 trade? **REJECTED**
- ❌ 2.9:1 trade? **REJECTED**
- ✅ 3.0:1 trade? **APPROVED** (if other criteria met)
- ✅ 3.5:1 trade? **PRIORITY** (excellent setup)
- ✅ 4.0:1+ trade? **MAXIMUM SIZE** (rare, high-quality)

**NO EXCEPTIONS - Quality over quantity!**
