## 📊 Capital Growth Projection

```
Month 0:  $2,271   (+$0)
Month 3:  $5,271   (+$3,000)   ← Safer leverage zone
Month 6:  $8,271   (+$6,000)   ← Very safe zone
Month 12: $14,271  (+$12,000)  ← Almost no leverage
Month 13: $15,271  (+$13,000)  ← No leverage needed!

### With Conservative Trading P&L (Estimate)
Assuming 60% win rate, 3 trades/week, $500 avg profit per winner:

```
Month 0:  $2,271
Month 3:  $5,271 + $3,600 P&L = $8,871   (1.69x leverage!)
Month 6:  $8,271 + $10,800 P&L = $19,071  (0.79x - NO leverage!)
Month 12: $14,271 + $28,800 P&L = $43,071 (0.35x - 3x positions!)
```

**Key Insight**: If you trade profitably, you'll reach no-leverage status much faster!
