## 🚨 WHY THIS FOLDER EXISTS

**Problem**: Coinbase Sandbox has FAKE prices ($990,000 BTC) - useless for testing!

**Solution**: Internal backtesting with REAL historical data from:
- ✅ Yahoo Finance (free, unlimited)
- ✅ CoinGecko (free tier)
- ✅ Binance historical data (free)
- ✅ Multiple exchanges (aggregated real prices)

**Result**: Rick trades with ACTUAL market behavior, not sandbox nonsense!
